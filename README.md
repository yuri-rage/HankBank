## HankBank
A Flask-SQLAlchemy driven children's allowance manager for families.

Designed to act like a checking/savings account with deposits and withdrawals directly managed by children with transactions shown as "pending" until approved/declined by parents.

Can be hosted on any Flask capable web server.  Built with Raspberry Pi in mind.

Run the init_db.py script to create a blank database in the root directory.  The first user to sign up is designated as the administrator (can be changed later).
